EXT2FS_CLI -- Read/write EXT2 filesystem from Windows.
You have to input the name of device or image file which contains EXT2 filesystem before accessing it. Valid device names in Windows are "\\.\PhysicalDrive0", "\\.\D:", etc.
If successful, the string "EXT2FS>> " will be printed, and you can input commands to access files in EXT2 filesystem.

This program can only run in Windows.
Do not use this program to read/write EXT4 filesystem.
Exiting from this program abnormally may corrupt filesystem.
